# 12. Soft Robotics

## Research
I found myself very inspired by the Pnebotics. Their work is really exiting, and blew my mind when they actual y started picking up things with the pneumatic robots.

I also remembered this architect, Its also a proof of concept that the technology can be applied in a consumer space.

Long ago made a chair out of inflated metal. It seems the patterns was what gave it the shape, and not the air obstructions but it is non the less inspiring.

## Inflatable Textile Vinyl

### Materials
In order to work with this process, we acquired Textile Vinyl, commonly understood as stamping vinyl for t-shirts.  

- The Brand is Chemical US  

- The material specifically is Polyurethane Metallic 461 Super zinc, we tried with other materials with less success.  There was also this cool perforated material, but it became counterproductive.

Recommendations for use: 293 F, 15s . Be careful as the material is thin.  
The wax paper in my case was also sort of sticking, so I used double Wax Paper, wax side out.
#### Impatient Attempt

The first trial, I left the material too in the iron and I later was not able to pull out.

##Concept In use: Add wings to a Nike Cortez

I thought it be cool if a sneaker had wings, back in the Athens, Hermes, the god of speed and messenger to all other gods was portrayed with winds in his feet. Its a concept that has resonated ever since, the speed, the dream of flight and recently Foot Locker's logo.
