In the same way that the wearables industry is integrating fashion practices in their development, we envision new partnerships between the biotech/tech companies and skin professionals such as makeup artistsâ€¦

##Concept : Meditation Tattoo
Meditation is an old practice, that can be found in one form or another in multiple cultures. Recently has also seen a resurgence in our culture due to all the health benefits.

A foreheads tattoo, representing a third eye, that turns on and tells people around you, you are in a meditative state.. or close to it. Also it should look good in photos, and I've picked the habit too.

###The Construction
![](../images/ta-w13-meditatoo.JPG)
I was planning to use:  

 -  Attiny 85  

 -  LED, small  

 -  CR2032 battery  

 -  Thin wire  

 -  Transparent layer of Vinyl, by US Chemicals, also has glue innately.  Its sort of like a sticky note.

### Code
   ```   
   //                        attiny85
   //                   reset -+---+- power
   // (on while touching) pb3 -+*  +- pb2 (toggled by touch)
   //       (touch input) pb4 -+   +- pb1 (fading while touching)
   //                  ground -+---+- pb0 (fading always)


   int fadepin1 = 0; // the led that fades on and off
   int fadepin2 = 1; // the led that fades on and off while you're touching the input pin
   int togglepin = 2; // the led that's toggled when you touch the input pin
   int steadypin = 3; // the led that's on while you're touching the input pin

   int calibration = 0;
   int previous;

   int randomval = 0;
   int fadeval = 0, fadestep = 1;
   int togglestate = LOW;

   void setup()
   {
     pinMode(fadepin1, OUTPUT);
     pinMode(fadepin2, OUTPUT);
     pinMode(togglepin, OUTPUT);
     pinMode(steadypin, OUTPUT);

     delay(100);
     for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
       calibration += chargeTime(PB4);
       delay(20);
     }
     calibration = (calibration + 4) / 8;
   }

   void loop()
   {
     int n = chargeTime(PB4);

     if (n > calibration) digitalWrite(steadypin, HIGH);
     else digitalWrite(steadypin, LOW);

     analogWrite(fadepin1, fadeval);
     if (n > calibration) analogWrite(fadepin2, fadeval);
     else analogWrite(fadepin2, 0);
     fadeval = fadeval + fadestep;
     if (fadeval == 255) fadestep = -1;
     if (fadeval == 0) fadestep = 1;

     if (previous <= calibration && n > calibration) {
       if (togglestate == LOW) togglestate = HIGH;
       else togglestate = LOW;

       digitalWrite(togglepin, togglestate);
     }

     previous = n;

     delayMicroseconds(500);
   }

   byte chargeTime(byte pin)
   {
     byte mask = (1 << pin);
     byte i;

     DDRB &= ~mask; // input
     PORTB |= mask; // pull-up on

     for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
       if (PINB & mask) break;
     }

     PORTB &= ~mask; // pull-up off
     DDRB |= mask; // discharge

     return i;
   }

   ```
