## About me

Deep understanding in all things manufacturing attracts and perplexes me. I have a passion for observing and appreciating my surroundings, as such surrounding myself with cool things. Things to use, seat and interact with.

## My background

I'm curious laid back designer, and life long student. Graduated from Carleton University as a bachelor of Industrial design, did a specialization in Footwear design in IED Madrid and constantly strive to learn more and grow.

Developed in Quito's manufacturing industry regarding Construction Furniture and Footwear design, always in-house, always next to the factory so I understand what and how things get done.
